Soon we will release a replament of Batchmove, it will be replaced by BatchToolsLite.
BatchToolsLite will be able to move post.
BatchToolsLite will also delete a set of posts selected set with selector

It is new made, and seperated in a free and pro version.
The free version still can do move posts to and from categories.

BatchMove has evolved to a BATCH toolbox for Wordpress with all kinds of tools available.

    As ever, move,add or delete posts to category
    Delete selected posts
    Delete revisions of all or selected posts
    Remove or change author of all or selected posts
    Change status of selected posts
    Change posts type of selected posts

We are still testing and checking, in february we are able to delever our toolbox.
On or website http://www.abs-hosting.nl/cms/blog/batchmove/ there is information how to get that version.

You can Add, Update or Delete posts categories.
First you make a selection of the records you want to change, then choose new category and the action.
Thats all, send your request and the changes are made, the program send you direct to the choosen action category.

We have made BatchMove for WP users who are maintain large Wordpress
implementations.

The exact use is to move a lot of posts to an ohter category, for example
all post from news category who from for 1 january to archive
archive->2011 or category any name you want.
Or just what you want, the different is that this routine can update/add/delete
and not just add a post to a category.

It will also remove a category from a list of posts, also if a posts has
two or more categories where it belongs to.
So when a post belongs to news and information, it is possible to remove
only category news or information, but it also is possible in one action
to update it just to category achive (or whatever you want).
A screenshot is found here : "http://www.walchum.info/plugin/wp-batch-move.jpg"

Language files batch-move-en_EN.mo, batch-move-de_DE.mo, batch-move-nl_NL.mo now supported.
Options are in progress, like set a number of rows.
At the end of this development we complete this plugin to a realy useful archive solution.

If using this for the first time, don't forget to make a BACKUP before!
