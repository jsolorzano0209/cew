== Description ==

<blockquote class="top">

<h3 class="top">NextGEN Facebook has been replaced by WPSSO Core</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core</a> plugin is a fork / child of NextGEN Facebook &mdash; they're both <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/wpsso/">Free and available on WordPress.org</a>, have the same plugin author and developer, but WPSSO Core is distributed without the social sharing buttons and their replaced features. Social sharing buttons are distributed separately, as optional add-ons for WPSSO Core. You can choose not to install any social sharing buttons, use the traditional <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ssb/">WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons</a> (found in NextGEN Facebook), the latest <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-rrssb/">WPSSO Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons</a> add-on, or any 3rd party social sharing buttons plugin.</p>

<p><strong>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core</a> plugin has also continued to evolve and offers many features not found in NextGEN Facebook, including support for the new Gutenberg editor in WordPress 5.</strong> You should upgrade from NextGEN Facebook to WPSSO Core immediately (see bellow for details).</p>

<h4>WPSSO Core offers several optional add-ons:</h4>

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-am/">WPSSO Mobile App Meta</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-organization/">WPSSO Organization Markup</a></li>

 	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-user-locale/">WPSSO User Locale Selector</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Upgrading from NextGEN Facebook to WPSSO Core is easy:</h4>

<p>After enabling the "Preserve Settings on Uninstall" option in the NGFB &gt; Essential settings page, you can deactivate and uninstall the NextGEN Facebook plugin, then install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core</a> plugin &mdash; all your previous NGFB settings will be preserved.</p>

**Complete and accurate meta tags for awesome looking shares on Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Twitter, etc - no matter how URLs are shared or re-shared!**

NextGEN Facebook creates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Twitter Cards, Google Rich Cards / SEO, Pinterest Rich Pins, and more &mdash; including descriptions, titles, hashtags, complete image markup, complete video markup, eCommerce product markup, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing content.

**NextGEN Facebook uses your *existing content* for meta tags and Schema markup:**

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, select images / videos, etc. NextGEN Facebook reads all of your existing WordPress content automatically &mdash; and if you want, you can also fine-tune and customize just about everything. ;-)

**NextGEN Facebook includes advanced *quality control* features and options:**

NextGEN Facebook checks minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, verifies the front-end webpage for duplicate meta tags, shows notices for missing and required images, and validates theme header templates.

**NextGEN Facebook offers special meta tags and features for Pinterest:**

NextGEN Facebook provides a specific image for the Pinterest Pin It button, excludes non-relevant images from being detected by Pinterest, and prevents conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook Open Graph meta tag values.

**NextGEN Facebook can enhance and integrate with your favorite SEO plugin:**

NextGEN Facebook specializes in providing all the meta tags and Schema markup social sites and search engines need &mdash; and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools!

**NextGEN Facebook is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

NextGEN Facebook makes full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and loads only the PHP library files and object classes it needs, keeping its code small, fast, and light. NextGEN Facebook is also fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).
